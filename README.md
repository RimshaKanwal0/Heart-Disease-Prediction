# Heart Disease Prediction Project
# Overview
This repository contains a heart disease prediction project using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features using different models, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest(RF).

# Best Performing Model
Among the classifiers evaluated, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) achieved the highest training accuracy of 100% and a testing accuracy of 86%.GBM is highly effective but may overfit the training data, making it suitable for scenarios where training accuracy is crucial and interpretability is less of a concern.RF offers a good balance between training and testing performance, making it ideal for applications where generalization and robustness are important.
