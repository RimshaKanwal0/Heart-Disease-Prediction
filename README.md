# Heart Disease Prediction Project
# Overview
This repository contains a heart disease prediction project using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features using different models, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest(RF).
# Setup
1)Open the project in Google Colab.<br>
2)Upload the dataset to the Colab environment or link it from Google Drive.<br>
3)Run the provided Google Colab notebooks to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.<br>
# Project Structure
-data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.<br>
-notebooks/: Google Colab notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.<br>
-scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.<br>
-models/: Saved models and their respective performance metrics.<br>
-README.md: This file.
